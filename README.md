## Introduction

This project explores gender parity in access to water and the challenges surrounding water collection in the fictional state of Maji Ndogo. In Maji Ndogo, water collection is a daily necessity, with residents frequently relying on various water sources during vulnerable early morning and late evening hours. This situation poses significant risks, particularly for women, who often bear the primary responsibility for water collection.

Our goal is to highlight the disparities between men and women in water access and to shed light on the risks and challenges they face. Through gender-specific data analysis, this project aims to inform better decision-making and encourage solutions for safer, more equitable access to water.

Key objectives of the project include:

Visualizing queue compositions of men, women, and children over various days across different provinces to understand demographics accessing these vital resources.
Utilizing Power BI to explore water usage patterns, highlighting gender distribution in queues at multiple water sources, including wells, rivers, and shared taps. This analysis identifies potential disparities in access and pinpoints days with longer queues and higher demand.
Investigating environmental factors, specifically water source pollution across the provinces, to identify sources needing immediate attention and repair.
Additionally, the project will provide insights into the overall impact of water access challenges in Maji Ndogo, such as:

Understanding the total number of people affected by water access issues.
Assessing the financial requirements for necessary upgrades and identifying specific expenditure areas.
Offering a comprehensive breakdown of spending by location and details on the utilization of funds.
Forecasting whether the allocated budget will be sufficient for project completion and exploring potential areas for cost reduction.
Presenting comprehensive data representation at national, provincial, and town levels to inform stakeholders about on-the-ground activities.
This repository will serve as a central hub for our findings and visualizations, guiding future steps and ensuring accountability in addressing the water access challenges faced by the people of Maji Ndogo.
